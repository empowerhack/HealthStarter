It is not a medical manual or a tool to come up with medical diagnoses or even get involved in medical treatment of refugees but rather a guide to care for people and help them to maintain good health and prevent basic health struggles. Please avoid making assumptions about what people already know or do not know about health, hygiene, and sanitation. People in the transit area are in an unknown environment, might be distressed and hence may not be in the position to take good decision for their health anymore. </p>

                            <p> <em> Entitlements </em> include the right to a system of health protection that gives everyone an equal opportunity to enjoy the highest attainable level of health. </p>
                            <p> Health policies and programmes have the ability to either promote or violate human rights, including the right to health, depending on the way they are designed or implemented. Taking steps to respect and protect human rights upholds the health sector’s responsibility to address everyone’s health (WHO fact sheet N°323) </p>
